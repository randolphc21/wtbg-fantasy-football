Week 16 Recap:

We conformed to the ESPN standard this year and ended on week 16 and I cannot love the decision any more. It’s going to be so great to enjoy the week 17 matchups stress-free and not have to worry about “are the Saints going to bench Drew Brees?”. We are really making strides in this league. Let’s breakdown the final week of the season and see what’s in store for us going forward.

Dylan vs. Burger:

Hats off to Dylan. So many respectable moves that went into this championship victory. Earlier in the week, I was questioning his decision to drop Trey Burton because he replaced him with Allie’s cousin Chris Herndon. Neva heard of him. But this random ass Jets tight end went out and caught 4 passes for 82 yards and a tuddie. Then things got really interesting when his bread and butter, Todd Gurley, was finally ruled as inactive midway through the 1:00 games. Todd had vaulted Dylan to the winner’s circle so many times this year, and I’ll be honest, I thought that this roster was top-heavy with him at the helm. But a championship team is not carried by one man alone. Dylan went out and picked up CJ Anderson as soon as he heard the news that Gurley was questionable. CJ was on his couch just last week after the Panthers dropped him earlier in the season, but Dylan saw enough in him to send his ass out there in the most important matchup of his life. He could have easily sent out Matt Breida who has been relatively consistent all year, but he stuck with his gut and played Anderson. It was like Gurley never even left, as he dropped 22 on the Cardinals. Even with Anderson’s 22, Dylan still needed help from Russell Wilson and Damien Williams. They both came out and played out of their minds for their manager, and alas, the trophy will be coming to Charlotte, NC. Make sure you keep us all up-to-date on how you are going to acquire the trophy from Frank, when you are going to get your name engraved, etc. As for Burger, it was yet another example of being the bridesmaid and not the bride. Every year he manages to assemble a powerhouse squad that tends to come up just short. He’s a hell of a competitor and I expect him to get over the top sooner rather than later.

Dom vs. Frank:

As Frank mentioned in the group chat, things really went south with his team once footage of Kareem beating a woman was released to the public. He was forced to start some dude named Kalen Ballage, it was hard to watch. Gronk has been virtually non-existent the last couple weeks. Dom was able to take advantage of these shortcomings and now he’s got his $100 entry fee back in his wallet. This team had championship potential but just did not put it together at key moments in the season. Saquon was a stud all year and will be a first ballot hall of famer if he even continues this production for 5 more years. Congrats on being able to ease the burden on some of your Christmas shopping.

Stan vs. West:

This matchup is not officially over yet, but I can write this recap with the utmost confidence that it is all but over. Unless Tim Patrick puts up 52 and Doug Martin and Dasean Hamilton put up 0, West is your 2018 Sacko. Just the fact that I had to type those three names in one sentence should be all you need to know about how the seasons went for these two guys. In fairness, Stan got the short end of the stick this season. His total points were decent at 1334, which bested the likes of Greg, Josh, and of course, West. Stan had by far the most points scored against him this season, largely thanks to yours truly dropping 150+ on him on two separate occasions. His unluckiness continued last week against Zach when it appeared that he had everything under control, but pissed it away late. So here he found himself in the Sacko against the favorite to win it all year. This week, Stan looked like anything but a Sacko. Big Ben and Antonio went back to their dominant ways and made sure Stan would not finish last this year. Now let’s get to West… where do we begin? He finally made the move to drop Le’Veon Bell in week 16. He never did change his team name from his 2017 Sacko season. I’m not sure if he made a waiver claim all year, but he did have some add/drops just minutes before kickoff. I’ve had him at the bottom of the power rankings for most weeks this season with the exception of a few dark weeks when I put myself there, but I knew in my heart it wasn’t true. West went back-to-back like his name is Aubrey Drake Graham. I look forward to the quality of this Instagram after what we saw with the video slideshow in Vegas in August. He said he’s looking to come out hot with this Instagram in January. “New year new me”, he says. So make sure you spread the word to all of your followers once it goes live so we can get maximum exposure to the people.

That wraps up another fantastic season of fantasy football. It did not go quite as I expected for my team, but such is life. Nothing better than shit-talking with your homies for 16 weeks in a row as you enjoy the greatest game on the planet. I feel as though we have reached an elite level in this league and not many can match up with it. However, there is always room for improvement. If you have any ideas of ways we can make this league greater, share them and we will discuss as a congregation. 

2019 Preview:

-      LEAGUE WEBSITE: JJ just hit me up last night and asked me about the progress. I’ll be honest, I’ve been slacking lately with a lot of shit going on, but once I have nothing to do in the offseason I’ll be back in the lab with JJ. We have another meeting setup for next week to get this shit back on track.

-      DRAFT: Our new champion will determine where we will meet for the 2019 draft. I have the utmost confidence that he will choose a location that will be enjoyable and unique. Fellas, it’s only December, but go ahead and lock down your calendars for Labor Day weekend and the weekend before that. I’m sure that’s when we will be drafting and we want to maximize league attendance to ensure that we all have a great time.

-      DRAFT ORDER: I think we should find a fun way to determine the draft order that in some way takes into account the final league standings. We brainstormed some ideas, but we’ve got some time to finalize it. Get creative.

-      2019 SACKO: It’s never too early to start thinking about how to punish the Sacko. If you think of something embarrassing, share it with the group.

That’s a wrap on the season dudes. Once again, it has been a pleasure being your commish. I hope you all have a Merry Christmas, pull the Jackets through as they close the book on the Paul Johnson era and begin the Collins era, and have a Happy New Year.

Love,

Chase
